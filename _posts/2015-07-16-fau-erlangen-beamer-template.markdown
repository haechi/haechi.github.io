I finally found some time to upload the presentation theme I used for my doctor defense at the University of Erlangen. This beamer theme is derived from the [beamer-polymtl](https://github.com/mvonthron/beamer-polymtl) theme done by Manuel Vonthron. The full name of the university is rather long Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen NÃ¼rnberg, clearly to long to fit comfortably on any presentation slide. Thus I went with the abbreviation FAU-Erlangen, since the technical faculty in located in Erlangen.

The defense did not require the preparation of printed handouts, thus I focused on the color beamer theme itself. The FAU-Erlangen logo is composed of dark blue and grey, thus this should be the main colors in the theme. As highlight according to the color wheel a bright orange has been chosen. I don't think dark backgrounds are especially suited for scientific presentation, since they tend to include figures, which are usually with white background, thus creating a hard contrast with the dark background. I choose a bright gradient for the background to make it look modern, and work well with figures.

The title page background is a pdf file edited with OmniGraffle. Colors for the FAU logo have been slightly altered to match the presentation theme.

Example of the final presentation using the minipage environment for putting a figure on the left and the bullet list on the right.
![Block Environment]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/beamer-erlangen-03.jpg)
Example of block environments, the actual block is in the same color as the background, only the block title is emphasized.
